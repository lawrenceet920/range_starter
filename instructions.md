## Python: FOR Loops

### Getting Started

- Create a GitHub repo named: **range_starter**
    - Upload your project files to the repo
    - No need to share your repo with your teacher
    - Teacher will discuss your work with you during Teacher  Time

- Create a NEW folder on your workstation desktop
- Use VS Code to add your Python file to this new folder


### Objective

> *In this practice project, you'll learn how to:*
>
> * use the built-in range ( ) function to generate a list of numbers within a specified range
>
> * use the range ( ) function with a single argument
> 
> * use the range ( ) function with TWO arguments
>
> * use the range ( ) function with THREE arguments


### Your Tasks

- Complete the **TRY IT YOURSELF** activities, p. 60, PCC, **4-3 to 4-8**
- Use comments to label each activity in your script
  - Example: # 4-3 Counting to Twenty, # 4-6 Odd Numbers, etc.
- Test your script to make sure your `range()` function is working as it should
